**Blockbuster or Bust - An actor career sim

Conceived, designed, and initially built by Nathan Freeman and Reid Shipley during their General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive in January 2022.

**Technologies used: HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery

**Features *The object of the game is to get cast in a summer blockbuster. Once you've done that, you'll likely never have to work again! *But you have to work your way up by gaining experience in less visible roles. *Each game turn is 1 year of your career. Your agent gets you one "primo" audition each year from a randomized list of three options. Tell your agent which audition you want, and they'll make it happen! *The difficulty of getting cast in a job is directly related to the amount of XP it awards. *No matter how much experience you have, there's always a minimum 25% chance you won't win the job. *On the other hand, there's always a chance, however small, that you could win a job with very little experience. Every point of experience increases your chances of getting cast in jobs. *If you don't win the job, you earn 0 XP for that year. *If you do win the job, you earn the indicated amount of XP that year. *Your plan is to retire at age 75. If you don't get cast in a summer blockbuster by that age, the game will end!

**Many additional features to be added, hopefully down the road *A tiny percentage chance you could die each turn, ending the game, that increases as you age. *Take classes to build up a nominal amount of XP in years where your options are too risky. *Random XP-boosting events *Customize your "type", strengths and weaknesses and change your odds for earning different types of jobs accordingly *Add numerous additional possible jobs and win/loss conditions *So many more ideas!
